# Dog Food Product Page - HTML/CSS Implementation

## Overview

This project is a responsive product page for a premium dog food brand. The page is built using pure HTML and CSS, with a focus on responsive design, accessibility, and maintainable code. The design showcases the product's unique selling points through three distinct sections, each with its own layout and content focus.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files with a folder:

- `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure of the page
- `styles.css` - Contains all the CSS styling for the page
- `Assests` - Contains all the Iamges and icons used on the page
  The page is divided into three main sections:

1. **Product Introduction** - Showcases what makes the product different with a central image and surrounding features
2. **Nutrition Benefits** - Highlights the nutritional foundation with key statistics and a dog image
3. **Health Benefits** - Explains the gastrointestinal health benefits and prebiotics in two subsections

## HTML Structure

The HTML follows a semantic structure using appropriate tags for better accessibility and SEO:

```html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    &lt;!-- Meta tags and title -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    &lt;!-- Section 1: Product Introduction -->
    <section class="product-section">
      <div class="container">
        <h1>...</h1>
        <div class="features-grid">...</div>
        <div class="cta-section">...</div>
      </div>
    </section>

    &lt;!-- Section 2: Nutrition Benefits -->
    <section class="nutrition-section">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="nutrition-grid">...</div>
      </div>
    </section>

    &lt;!-- Section 3: Health Benefits -->
    <section class="health-section">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="health-grid">...</div>
        <div class="health-grid reverse">...</div>
      </div>
    </section>
  </body>
</html>
```
